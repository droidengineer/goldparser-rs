# Binaries

`egtutil` is a binary in the \bin directory for basic operations on compiled `Enhanced Grammar Tables` and serves as a working example of implementing the parsers from this crate. The 
interactive feature implements a [REPL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-repl)-like environment to walk through the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of your parsed source code.
